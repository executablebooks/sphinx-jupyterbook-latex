## 0.4.0 - 2021-05-03

This release updates the name of this package from `jupyterbook-latex` to
`sphinx-jupyterbook-latex` as it is now a `sphinx` extension rather than a
`jupyterbook` extension.

## 0.3.1 - 2021-06-01

This is a **minor** release to increase the flexibility for installation requirements

### Maintenance

- Updated [version pinning](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterbook-latex/pull/60) for
  `sphinx-external-toc` and `sphinxcontrib-bibtex`


## 0.3.0 - 2021-05-05

This release essentially re-writes the most of the code to:

1. Make this package a "standalone" sphinx extension, independent of jupyter-book, i.e. not dependant on the presence of a `_toc.yml`.
2. Ensure HTML builds are not broken, by moving LaTeX specific doctree manipulations to post-transforms (which are builder specific)
3. Make `myst_nb` requirement optional, and check for compatibility
4. Auto-infer `latex_toplevel_sectioning`, when the `sphinx-external-toc` extension is being used.

The package maintenance has also been improved; adding mypy type-checking and other pre-commit hooks.
